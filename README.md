      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The School of Freedom is dedicated to fostering education and empowerment for Afghan girls, guiding them toward independence and job opportunities. The educational situation in Afghanistan has been deeply affected by years of conflict, political instability, and social constraints, particularly limiting girls' access to education.</p>
      <p>We offer tailored programs and mentorship to create a nurturing environment where girls can thrive both academically and professionally. Our expertise spans educational development, leadership training, and advocacy for gender equality. Weâ€™re committed to breaking societal barriers to ensure Afghan girls gain equal access to opportunity.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., we support Afghan refugee youth through after-school tutoring, college prep, ESL mentorship, and are in the process of launching a dual-immersion charter school in Sacramento.</p>
